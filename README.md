### Hi, I'm Marit ðŸ‘‹

I work mainly as a Front-end developer. I have a bachelor degree in Information Technology at NTNU and have recently finished my first year studying Front-end developement at Noroff. I have studied several years of my adult life so I will not continue my stuides at Noroff for now. But I am sure I would like to study some more eventually.

My githud mainly contains projects from my studies, but I hope to have the time to work on my own projects some time ðŸ˜„.
